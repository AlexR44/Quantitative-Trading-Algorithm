# Quantitative-Trading-Algorithm
## Project Description
As a whole, this is a portfolio building strategy that combines machine learning to create predictive learning algorithms, features engineering statistics, and portfolio management strategies. Its main features include:
* A PostgreSQL database where stock data for a vast number of equities are stored
* Features engineering and data transtormation through the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* A search for tradeable stocks from the database based on the Sharpe criterion
* A trading strategy created using the following machine learning algorithms:
  * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
  * Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
  * Random Forest
* The use of ensemble methods to select the most profitable stocks
* Portfolio Risk Management employing the mean-variance-skewness-kurtosis criterion
